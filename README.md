# BainFamilyCollection

Collection of resources used in processing the Bain Family Collection materials held by Special Collections at the University of Tennessee by Jeremy D. Moore (jeremy.d.moore@utk.edu)


* AutoCropper Jupyter Notebook used to automatically crop and rotate images of 100+ year old scrapbooks.
** Pages were scanned so the i2s Quartz A1 Suprascan HD would have to scan over the short side and not the long side of each page, shortening the scan time
